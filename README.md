# Image Classification for Hand Signals

This project implements different algorithms to classify hand signals representing letters (A, B, C, D) and numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.). It will compare the accuracy and efficiency of various models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.

## Applications
- **Sign Language Recognition:** Translating hand signals into text or speech to facilitate communication for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
- **UI/UX for Accessibility:** Enhancing user interfaces for individuals with disabilities by enabling gesture-based controls.
- **News Translation:** Using hand signals to translate news content.
